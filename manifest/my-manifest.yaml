# Create a Deployment
# Deployments describe a set of identical Pods without unique identities. A Deployment will run multiple replicas of your application and will automatically replace instances that fail or become unresponsive.

# Create a CronJob

# Create a Pod
# A Pod is the basic building block of Kubernetesâ€“the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. A Pod represents a running process on your cluster.

# Create a ReplicaSet
# A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. You can specify how many replicas of the pod that should be running by editing the 'replicas' key in the example below.
